# Option pricing

This is a work in progress for myself to explore option pricing. Currently this only contains an implementation of Black Scholes and Monte Carlo methods for pricing an option. Later on I will also be incorporating FX pricing as well.

My next steps include the following:

- IVS modelling
- ML models (decision trees and neural networks)
- Backtesting
- Risk management & Hedging Strategies
- Brownian motion simulation
- Real time data processiing
